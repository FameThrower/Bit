===========================================================

How's it going guys. This is our repository so that we can keep all code up to date between users.

==========================================================

This is a to do list for our group.  

**handled?**  
1) get hotel for competition (sounds like IEEE group wll handle it)  
2) get rental vehicle for competition (sounds like IEEE group will handle it)  

~~**OMFG**~~ **golly jeebers guys**, GET TO IT
3) order letter kit @ Chelcie.Lanaux@iv-aga.com  
4) complete intent to compete forum  
5) make course  
6) build it.  

**DUE FEB 7**  
7) Make a paper for the competition (text mitch for info if you didnt already receive it).  


Current work to complete/errors to look for  
1) why is the left wheel slow?  
2) *Where is the course?*  
3) does opencv code work still?  
4) sensors.... we need blackline sensors and code for them to work. i.e. isblackline() 1 or 0 response  
               SRF 08 code so it will respond with a distance  
5) movement code testing and development.  
               Does it move the exact distance we command it too?  
    Does it move in a straight line?  
    Can we interrupt its movement and detemine with 1"> certainty  
6) add all data sheets   
7) Beaglebone maze code  
    Still need to remember the critical path through the maze  
    How to get from search mode to critical path mode - maybe as simple as  
    on reset, pressing button the first time. Once every path is explored,  
    robot waits until button is pressed again for critical path mode??  
8) Don't forget LEDs and USB stuff
