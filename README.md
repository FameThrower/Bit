senior project IEEE 2015 Robot Competition

===========================================================

How's it going guys. This is our repository so that we can keep all code up to date between users.

==========================================================

This is a to do list for our group.  
handled?  
1) get hotel for competition (sounds like IEEE group wll handle it)  
2) get rental vehicle for competition (sounds like IEEE group will handle it)  

~~**OMFG**~~ **golly jeebers guys**, GET TO IT
3) order letter kit @ Chelcie.Lanaux@iv-aga.com  
4) complete intent to compete forum  
5) make course  
6) build it.  

DUE FEB 7  
7) Make a paper for the competition (text mitch for info if you didnt already receive it).  


Current work to complete/errors to look for  
1) why is the left wheel slow?  
2) *Where is the course?*  
3) does opencv code work still?  
4) sensors.... we need blackline sensors and code for them to work. i.e. isblackline() 1 or 0 response  
               SRF 08 code so it will respond with a distance  
5) movement code testing and development.  
    Does it move the exact distance we command it too?  
    Does it move in a straight line?  
    Can we interrupt its movement and detemine with 1"> certainty  
6) (Add to this list)  
=============================================================  
6) add all data sheets
